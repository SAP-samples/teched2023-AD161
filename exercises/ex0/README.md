# Preparation

Let's start the exercise and see whether everything is ready to go.
Please make sure you have all the necessary prerequisites listed below. If not, please raise your voice during the meeting so that we can assist you early in the session.

## Prerequisites
Please keep the following links and resources available:

1. You need a browser, preferably Google Chrome
1. Logon to the Development Lobby  
https://lcapteched-applicationdevelopment.lcnc.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/lobby
1. Your user is assigned to you by the moderator of the tutorial. It has the format **lowcodeuser+XXX@gmail.com where XXX is a number**.
1. To get the password for this user, open this [application](https://lcapteched.launchpad.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/lcapUserList.UserListUsers-0.0.1/index.html). The user and the password for this application will be told to you by the moderator of the workshop
1. **In almost every chapter of this tutorial there is a reference to the number XXX from your user, so a 3 digit number like 001. Make sure that you remember it well.** It is important as we will use these numbers, where every user has a different one, in order to create different names for applications and other artifacts. As we will deploy all the the artifacts to the same Business Technology Platform account, it is important that they all differ in the names and identifiers, so there are no clashes

## General troubleshooting

1. If you encounter an issue with the Low-Code perspective in the Business Application Studio (BAS) you can check the logs under: File > Open > /home/user/lcap.home.2023-11-02.log (if you encounter the issue at any other day, you need to update the file name with the date of that day)

1. If something does not work in the editor, but it should, you can try restarting the whole workspace. To do so, open this URL: https://lcapteched.eu10cf.applicationstudio.cloud.sap/index.html?alldevspaces=true.  
Here you see the so-called Dev Spaces of the Business application studio. Click on the "Stop" button. Once the Dev Space stopped, you can simply restart it. In order to go back to your Low-Code perspective you must go through the lobby - located here:
