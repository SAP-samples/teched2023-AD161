# AD161 - Build Full-Stack Applications with BuildCode Tools

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2023 session called AD161 - Build Full-Stack Applications with BuildCode Tools

## Overview

In this session, you will learn how to use SAP Build Code with the SAP Business Application Studio to develop apps rapidly on SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). You will learn how to build a full-blown CRUD application, including backend services and a UI application, in a matter of minutes with only visual editors. You will connect the application to an SAP S/4HANA API. You will learn how to easily switch to code, and continue working from there to create additional business logic for your service to finally make the application available on BTP with a "one-click deployment"

## The Use Case

In this session, we will create an application for Incident Management. To achieve this, we will create a new backend service using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), and a web application based on Fiori elements with which users can manage Incidents.
