# AD262 - Create Extensions to SAP S/4HANA Using ABAP Cloud and SAP Build 

## Description

This repository contains the material for the SAP TechEd 2022 session called â€¢	AD262 Create Extensions to SAP S/4HANA Using ABAP Cloud and SAP Build 

## Overview

In this session you will learn how to use SAP Build Code with the SAP SAP Business Application Studio (BAS) to rapidly develop apps on SAP Business
Technology Platform (SAP BTP). You will learn how to build a full blow CRUD application including backend services and a UI application in a matter of minutes with only visual editors. You will connect the application to an SAP S/4HANA API. Learn how to easily switch to code, work on from there to create additional business logic for your service to finally make the application available on BTP with a "one click deployment"

## The Use Case

In this session we will create an application for Incidents Management.

To achieve this, we will create a new backend service using the Cloud Application Programming Model (CAP), and a web application based on Fiori elements with which users can create Incidents.
